# Authentication

## Access model

| Action | Auth required |
|--------|---------------|
| List / retrieve any data resource (`GET`) | **No** — public read |
| Contribute data (`POST /api/contribute/`) | Yes — token |
| Administrative writes (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` on data resources) | Yes — admin token |

Read access is open so anyone can query the platform. Writes are restricted.

## Obtaining a token

Tokens use DRF's token authentication. An administrator can issue one from the Django
admin, or via the token endpoint if enabled:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://dev.omethe.us/api-token-auth/" \
  -d "username=<user>&password=<password>"
# -> {"token": "9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b"}
```

## Using a token

Send it in the `Authorization` header as `Token <your-token>`:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b" \
  "https://dev.omethe.us/api/contribute/status/123/"
```

In Swagger UI (`/api/docs/`), click **Authorize** and paste `Token <your-token>`; it is
persisted across requests so you can "try it out" on protected endpoints.

## Rate limits

The API is throttled:

| Caller | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Anonymous | 100 requests/day |
| Authenticated | 1000 requests/day |

If you need higher limits for a research workload, contact the maintainers (see the
[repository](https://github.com/LekiaAnonim/kineticmodelssite)).

!!! tip
    For bulk/automated access, generate a [client SDK](clients.md) and configure it once
    with your token and base URL.
